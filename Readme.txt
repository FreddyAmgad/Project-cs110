This project is a travel management system that allows users to sign up and log in. Once logged in, users can register for flights and cruises, with the system utilizing a shortest path algorithm to find the most efficient routes. Trip prices are calculated based on various factors, including distance and accommodations. Additionally, users can make hotel reservations through the system. Each user account is linked to a Visa account, enabling convenient payments via card or cash.
